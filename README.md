# Wordless ~ Installation

To run the installation, go to the `almat_expo` directory
and run a local python webserver.

```
> cd ~/almat_expo/
python -m SimpleHTTPServer
```

NOTE: for python version 3.X use `python -m http.server`

Next open chromium and navigate to `localhost:8000`

Click 'START', which will open two new windows (make sure popups are enabled).

Move each of the windows to one of the two screens of the installation and
click anywhere inside of the window to make it full screen.
