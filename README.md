# Wordless ~ Installation

1. To run the installation, go to the `almat_wordless` directory
and run the startup script.

```
./start.sh
```

2. In the browser window that opens, click 'START', which will open
two new windows (make sure popups are enabled).

3. Move each of the windows to one of the two screens of the installation and
click anywhere inside of the window to make it full screen.


## ALTERNATIVELY: start a local python webserver in the project directory

```
> cd ~/almat_wordless/
python -m SimpleHTTPServer
```

open chromium and navigate to `localhost:8000`
