feldman|your work beautifully depicts|0_feldman.wav
feldman|the absurdity of life|1_feldman.wav
feldman|and the waiting throughout our lives|2_feldman.wav
feldman|for something or someone|3_feldman.wav
feldman|who might eventually come to give meaning|4_feldman.wav
feldman|to our life but never really comes|5_feldman.wav
beckett|Thank you|6_beckett.wav
beckett|these  nineteen seventies still life works|7_beckett.wav
beckett|are among my favorites|8_beckett.wav
beckett|of your compositions|9_beckett.wav
feldman|It was very thought provoking|10_feldman.wav
beckett|yes|11_beckett.wav
beckett|the violin part is quiet|12_beckett.wav
beckett|but dazzlingly varied as is the orchestral part|13_beckett.wav
beckett|its basically a conversation|14_beckett.wav
beckett|the solo instrument and ensemble taking turns speaking|15_beckett.wav
feldman|if you're looking for a play|16_feldman.wav
feldman|that highlights the utter pointlessness of life|17_feldman.wav
feldman|look no further|18_feldman.wav
beckett|it is rarely used all at once|19_beckett.wav
beckett|like the other still lifes this is no conventional concerto|20_beckett.wav
beckett|there is no melodic line to follow|21_beckett.wav
beckett|no grand cadenzas|22_beckett.wav
beckett|a sign of things to come|23_beckett.wav
feldman|your carefully crafted dialogue|24_feldman.wav
feldman|that blurs the lines between characters|25_feldman.wav
feldman|and enhances a sense of isolation and futility|26_feldman.wav
feldman|as the main characters wait endlessly|27_feldman.wav
feldman|mindlessly|28_feldman.wav
feldman|for godot|29_feldman.wav
feldman|pronounced god oh|30_feldman.wav
beckett|you want experiment with your musical tastes|31_beckett.wav
beckett|try something original and confronting|32_beckett.wav
beckett|then this work is for you|33_beckett.wav
beckett|you are a unique voice in the field of music|34_beckett.wav
beckett|this piece is one of his foremost|35_beckett.wav
feldman|not as good as I thought|36_feldman.wav
feldman|a lot of repetition|37_feldman.wav
beckett|truth|38_beckett.wav
beckett|it is no easy listen|39_beckett.wav
feldman|it is like listening to two idiots|40_feldman.wav
feldman|talk all day about nothing|41_feldman.wav
beckett|and should not be heard with a cloud of prejudgements|42_beckett.wav
beckett|if you are willing to suspend|43_beckett.wav
beckett|what you might expect music to be|44_beckett.wav
feldman|I might be wrong|45_feldman.wav
feldman|but there is a possibility|46_feldman.wav
feldman|that music might not be an art form|47_feldman.wav
feldman|we dont really know what it could do as an art form|48_feldman.wav
feldman|we just dont|49_feldman.wav
beckett|I think it might follow the passage|50_beckett.wav
beckett|which treats of form|51_beckett.wav
beckett|as a concretion of content|52_beckett.wav
feldman|I cant explain it|53_feldman.wav
beckett|I tried a book shop today|54_beckett.wav
beckett|but found nothing that would please you|55_beckett.wav
feldman|but I feel|56_feldman.wav
feldman|that music essentially has pre opted memory|57_feldman.wav
feldman|to keep its intellectuality|58_feldman.wav
feldman|and its concentration|59_feldman.wav
feldman|rather than thinking of pitch structures|60_feldman.wav
feldman|form structures|61_feldman.wav
feldman|you see|62_feldman.wav
beckett|no less profuse|63_beckett.wav
beckett|a maudlin false teeth|64_beckett.wav
beckett|gobble-gobble discharge|65_beckett.wav
feldman|its absolutely a marvelous book|66_feldman.wav
feldman|but the product was used|67_feldman.wav
feldman|then again|68_feldman.wav
feldman|does it matter?|69_feldman.wav
feldman|wonder what the point of this insane exercise|70_feldman.wav
feldman|in the repetition of the scenes might be|71_feldman.wav
beckett|it is a delicate activity|72_beckett.wav
beckett|who has no interest in books|73_beckett.wav
beckett|and who cannot be persuaded that literacy is not a crime|74_beckett.wav
beckett|I might save myself|75_beckett.wav
beckett|the trouble of sending him anything further|76_beckett.wav
feldman|it took some time for me|77_feldman.wav
feldman|I went through all gamuts of possibility|78_feldman.wav
feldman|and with me it's the orchestration|79_feldman.wav
feldman|of the idea which determines the piece|80_feldman.wav
feldman|I wanted to find a vehicle|81_feldman.wav
beckett|I have a copy box stuffed to the brim|82_beckett.wav
beckett|with ECM|83_beckett.wav
beckett|a perfect match for this music|84_beckett.wav
beckett|producing a great recording with a beautifully judged performance|85_beckett.wav
feldman|I use about two lines of it|86_feldman.wav
feldman|and the image of Frank being dead|87_feldman.wav
feldman|but everything sounds live|88_feldman.wav
feldman|by that I mean|89_feldman.wav
feldman|that you have a live singer and two dead mikes|90_feldman.wav
feldman|you know|91_feldman.wav
beckett|Great!|92_beckett.wav
beckett|The first thing I heard was Rothko Chapel along with Why Patterns?|93_beckett.wav
beckett|Fantastic!|94_beckett.wav
beckett|then I heard the hat art recording of For Samuel Beckett|95_beckett.wav
beckett|played by the Ensemble Modern|96_beckett.wav
feldman|yes|97_feldman.wav
feldman|it started to take over the whole|98_feldman.wav
feldman|almost technical|99_feldman.wav
feldman|that kind of strange metaphor|100_feldman.wav
feldman|constructing the piece|101_feldman.wav
beckett|this is a high quality production|102_beckett.wav
beckett|I compared this version with the older Kronos version online|103_beckett.wav
feldman|it was to some degree a kind of minor hallucination|104_feldman.wav
feldman|and it did play a very important part|105_feldman.wav
feldman|that is|106_feldman.wav
feldman|theres something a little bit off|107_feldman.wav
feldman|the live against the dead|108_feldman.wav
feldman|I think|109_feldman.wav
feldman|is what makes the thing interesting for me|110_feldman.wav
beckett|I am glad you have found some peace|111_beckett.wav
beckett|and happiness|112_beckett.wav
beckett|here there is very little of either except perhaps today|113_beckett.wav
beckett|when this place is empty and silent|114_beckett.wav
beckett|I have started vaguely to work|115_beckett.wav
feldman|vital to life and thinking|116_feldman.wav
feldman|we gain a full frontal view of that|117_feldman.wav
feldman|which is mostly peripheral in the psyche|118_feldman.wav
beckett|last night I drank|119_beckett.wav
beckett|arent people shits?|120_beckett.wav
feldman|what the world doesnt need is another twenty five minute piece|121_feldman.wav
feldman|well|122_feldman.wav
feldman|thats the length of all my pieces youre doing|123_feldman.wav
beckett|I like that crouching brooding quality|124_beckett.wav
beckett|squatting on the moss|125_beckett.wav
beckett|crushing a petal|126_beckett.wav
beckett|licking his lips and rubbing his hands|127_beckett.wav
feldman|you know|128_feldman.wav
feldman|theyre reminding me|129_feldman.wav
feldman|being invited here and he called up to make a|130_feldman.wav
feldman|a substitution|131_feldman.wav
feldman|so with that behind me|132_feldman.wav
feldman|and upset that I couldnt|133_feldman.wav
feldman|for example|134_feldman.wav
feldman|program a Xenakis piece|135_feldman.wav
feldman|because it was only eleven minutes and too expensive|136_feldman.wav
beckett|I like him the best of them all|137_beckett.wav
beckett|because he doesn't beat his fists on the table|138_beckett.wav
beckett|with a very decent irregularity|139_beckett.wav
feldman|everybody complains that theres something wrong with contemporary music|140_feldman.wav
beckett|yesterday afternoon|141_beckett.wav
beckett|the music was so tepid that I was conscious of my neck|142_beckett.wav
feldman|I dont know|143_feldman.wav
feldman|if you saw that supplement in The Times|144_feldman.wav
feldman|months ago|145_feldman.wav
feldman|I was getting pretty fed up|146_feldman.wav
beckett|I scramble through lectures and chafe for the end of term|147_beckett.wav
beckett|when I hope to go away to Hamburg|148_beckett.wav
feldman|Im not here to champion twentieth century music|149_feldman.wav
beckett|I feel that Beethovens quartets are|150_beckett.wav
beckett|a waste of time|151_beckett.wav
beckett|his pigheaded refusal|152_beckett.wav
beckett|to make the best of a rather pettyfogging convention|153_beckett.wav
feldman|uh|154_feldman.wav
feldman|Wagner Beethoven died early in the century|155_feldman.wav
feldman|you know|156_feldman.wav
feldman|I mean|157_feldman.wav
feldman|the century wasnt that fantastic|158_feldman.wav
beckett|the town is superb|159_beckett.wav
beckett|I got here last friday|160_beckett.wav
beckett|twenty four hours late|161_beckett.wav
beckett|the gallery here was something of a disappointment|162_beckett.wav
beckett|but may improve|163_beckett.wav
beckett|but there is an appalling quantity of rubbish|164_beckett.wav
feldman|what an awful play|165_feldman.wav
feldman|but at least it was short|166_feldman.wav
feldman|if you are expecting Twilight dont even bother|167_feldman.wav
feldman|go to McDonalds to read their menu instead|168_feldman.wav
feldman|umm|169_feldman.wav
beckett|I suppose the Gilberts and Carduccis would feel honoured|170_beckett.wav
beckett|if Joyce signed a piece of his used toilet paper|171_beckett.wav
feldman|I feel that hierarchical assumptions are essentially|172_feldman.wav
feldman|an alibi|173_feldman.wav
feldman|to write the piece|174_feldman.wav
feldman|it is the center of the absurd|175_feldman.wav
beckett|I expected more generous rifts in the paralysis|176_beckett.wav
beckett|here nothing but fog and submission|177_beckett.wav
beckett|one rebus from dawn to dark|178_beckett.wav
beckett|in nothingness|179_beckett.wav
beckett|with words enclose|180_beckett.wav
feldman|what an odd adventure|181_feldman.wav
feldman|and what we dont like|182_feldman.wav
feldman|we consider an intrusion in our life|183_feldman.wav
feldman|it doesnt speak to you|184_feldman.wav
feldman|it doesnt help you|185_feldman.wav
feldman|you know|186_feldman.wav
beckett|I had heard rumours of my novel when speaking to publishers|187_beckett.wav
beckett|and that would have some translations for me in the near future|188_beckett.wav
beckett|of the short stay|189_beckett.wav
feldman|well|190_feldman.wav
feldman|that might help me next weekend|191_feldman.wav
feldman|I want to leave the door open|192_feldman.wav
feldman|but of course|193_feldman.wav
feldman|but without the radio|194_feldman.wav
feldman|the noise is utilitarian|195_feldman.wav
feldman|and juxtapose it in relation to a garbage heap|196_feldman.wav
beckett|I have an idea he may try and do the dirty|197_beckett.wav
beckett|he has no background and I have nothing to show|198_beckett.wav
beckett|nothingness|199_beckett.wav
beckett|the dim mind wayfaring through barren lands|200_beckett.wav
beckett|but Id rather send him poems|201_beckett.wav
